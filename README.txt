This is a simple GUI for Conway's Game of Life (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)

The back-end and the working logic is by Klaus Bayrhammer (klausbayrhammer @GitHub), and as soon as he releases his Code as a Jar (see issue #1) I'll remove his code ;)

IMPORTANT: This project requires at least Java 7 to run.
