This is a simple GUI for Conway's Game of Life (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)

The back-end and the working logic was by Klaus Bayrhammer (klausbayrhammer @GitHub), but lately I have updated it to my own game logic.

IMPORTANT: This project requires at least Java 7 to run.
